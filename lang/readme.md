# Dictionary support

This module provides dictionaries to the main project with which the project will have the ability to be multilanguage.

It also includes a python script in which it allows to generate new dictionaries based on another, the fact of generating dictionaries does not guarantee that the translations are correct, so it is recommended to carry out a review of each translated word.

This module contains a .json index file in which is the list of dictionaries available in the repository, said file can be downloaded by the program and show the list of dictionaries available to the user.
